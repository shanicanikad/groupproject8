"You Just Entered The Black Experience"

Welcome to the Black Excellence/ Black Fashion Project!


Here, (https://blk-experience.vercel.app/) the user enters the landing page where the user can chose between shopping the womens or mens collection.  

When the user clicks on 'Shop Men's', the user will be redirected to the men's fashion collection page (https://blk-experience.vercel.app/men). When the user clicks on the 'Shop Women's, the user will be redirected to the women's fashion collection page (https://blk-experience.vercel.app/women). 

At the top of the page is the nav bar labeled 'BLK Experience'. Here, the user can navigate between four different buttons: 'Home', 'Women's', 'Men's', and 'Create Brand'. The user can go back to the landing page by clicking 'Home', can be directed to either the men's or women's collections, or the user can make their own brand (The user can do this by clicking 'Create Brand'and filling out the provided form to create a brand).


Below, the user is able to update and delete information for each brand's collection by simply clicking 'Update' or 'Delete'. With 'Update', the user can update the provided form to update the information. 

When the user clicks on a brand's logo, they will then be redirected to the brand's current collection, provided with various tops, bottoms, shoes, and accessories.

At the very bottom of the page, there is a form and a 'Subscribe' button where the user can enter their email address and click the 'Subscribe' button. Once clicked, an alert will pop up on the screen saying, "Thank you for subscribing!"

** Front-end made with React.js and Bootstrap
** All buttons and forms were made using Storybook and Javascript



For the Women's and Men's Fashion APIs.

With https://sd-womens-fashion.herokuapp.com/, the user starts at the root url/directory which presents a blank page. Once here, the user needs to add either 'WomenFashion' to the root which redirects to the Women's Fashion API or add 'menswear' to the root to be redirect to the Men's Fashion API.

Once the user gets redirected to either API, the user can find four different womens or mens fashion brands, along with each brand's logo, CEO's name, type of fashion, price point, and different items within different categories.

The user can type https://sd-womens-fashion.herokuapp.com/WomenFashion/ or https://sd-womens-fashion.herokuapp.com/menswear/ and add any of the brand names provided to the end of the url to find specific information on that specfic brand.

New brands are created and added for the user to view.

Information for each brand is updated frequently.

When new collections are released, information on older collections are deleted frequently.

This API is based on the Women's Fashion API by Shanica Denis and the Men's Wear API by William Campbell.

**Back-end made with Mongo/ Mongoose, and Express
**APIs deployed using Heroku and MongoDB Atlas
